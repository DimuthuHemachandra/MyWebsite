I'm Dimuthu, an Astrophysicist turned Biomedical Engineer and Neuroscientist. Since May 2018, I work as a Researcher at the [Robarts Research Institute](https://www.robarts.ca/index.html) at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html).

I completed my PhD at the [Khan Computational Imaging Lab](hhttps://www.khanlab.ca/) of the [German Primate Center](https://www.dpz.eu), where I studied the effects of anesthesia on brain function using neuroimaging techniques, including functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and in vivo 2‚Äêphoton calcium imaging.

I care about promoting open, collaborative, and reproducible science. In my free time, you will find me dancing to swing music and trying to play the saxophone.
