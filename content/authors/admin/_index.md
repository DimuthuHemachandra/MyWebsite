I'm Dimuthu, an Astrophysicist turned Biomedical Engineer and Neuroscientist. Since May 2018, I work as a Researcher at the [Robarts Research Institute](https://www.robarts.ca/index.html) at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html).

I completed my PhD at the [Khan Computational Imaging Lab](hhttps://www.khanlab.ca/), where I studied the subcortical brain structures and brain connectivity using machine learning to detect neuro-degenerative diseases. 

I'm passionate about promoting open and collaborative science. I believe that sharing knowledge and working together is the key to progress.

In my free time, you'll find me exploring new places and capturing moments with my camera.
