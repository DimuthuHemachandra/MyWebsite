I’m Dimuthu, an Astrophysicist turned Biomedical Engineer and Neuroscientist. I study brain connectivity using machine learning and AI to better understand and detect neurodegenerative diseases. My work focuses on building data-driven models that advance neuroscience and support human health.

Currently, I’m a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Stanford University School of Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/poston-lab/people.html#postdocs)
, [working in collaboration with SRI International](https://www.sri.com/)
. Here, I develop image preprocessing pipelines to study the brain’s waste clearance system and explore its role in neurodegenerative diseases.

In 2018, I earned my PhD at the [Khan Computational Imaging Lab](hhttps://www.khanlab.ca/)
 at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html)
, where I focused on subcortical brain structures and brain connectivity, applying machine learning to detect neurodegenerative diseases.

I’m passionate about open and collaborative science—because I believe sharing knowledge and working together is the key to real progress.

When I’m not in the lab, you’ll probably find me exploring new places and capturing moments with my camera.
